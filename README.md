# PyBEL Resources

This repository is a location for keeping curated resources under version-control.


## Usage

This repository is a solution for keeping curated BEL resources under version control. When an appropriate
number of updates are made to a namespace or an annotation, they are given a new version number and copied
to Fraunhofer SCAI's instance of Artefactory for distribution at 
`https://arty.scai.fraunhofer.de/artifactory/bel/`

## BEL Template

A BEL template can be generated at http://pybel.scai.fraunhofer.de/curation/bel/template with automatic
population of document metadata, namespace definitions, and annotation definitions.
