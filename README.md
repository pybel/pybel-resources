This repository is a location for keeping curated resources under version-control.

## Namespaces and Annotations

### Updating

After making updates to namespaces and annotations in this GitHub repository, the files need to be copied to the underlying 
ownCloud folder to be distributed by Fraunhofer SCAI.

### Access

Definitions stored in ownCloud and can be accessed by the following URL pattern:

`https://owncloud.scai.fraunhofer.de/index.php/s/JsfpQvkdx3Y5EMx/download?path=selventa-protein-families.belns`

where `selventa-protein-families.belns` can be replaced with any of the definition files' names. See `template.bel` for a 
full list of namespaces and annotations.
